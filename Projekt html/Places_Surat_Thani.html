    <h1>Surat Thani</h1>
    <ol> Most known for a gigantic National Park and being directly next to the Rainforest it is a perfect 3 night stay. I recommend doing at least one night 
      tour in the jungle as that´s when you´re most likely to see animals such as snakes and many more. There are also several caves worth visiting. They can 
      be quite adventurous where you sometimes have to swim, climb or it´s simply very tight and there is just generally no light inside at all. Make sure to 
      have a guide whether you go into a cave or into the rainforest as you won´t find your way out on your own and there are larger areas without reception.
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Rainforest</li>
        <ol> You can see wild elephants, monkeys and potentially even wild tigers here. It´s a lot mor erealistic that you´ll only find snakes, spiders, blood leeches and fish.
            Here are also Rafflesia plants located (worlds largest bloom). According to the guide there are only 5 of them and they bloom to different times so you´ll need some luck.
        </ol>

      <li>Khao Sok National Park</li>
        <ol> A huge lake surrounded mostly by mountains. You can stay the night in bungalows on the lake which I wouldn´t recommend if you get seasick or don´t like eating fish. </ol>
