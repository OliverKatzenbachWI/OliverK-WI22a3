  <ul id="ListBangkokSights">
    <li><a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="dropdownMenuLink1" data-toggle="dropdown">Chinatown</a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuLink1">
        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#"></a> One of the huge street markets of Bangkok. It´s very known for it´s variety of Thai,Chinese and Japanese cuisine.
        It has a huge number of street stalls aswell as several dozen restaurants. I recommend going here for dinner at least once when you´re in Bangkok.
    </li>

    <li><a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="dropdownMenuLink1" data-toggle="dropdown">Wat Pho</a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuLink1">
        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#"></a> A Large Temple in Bangkok. The most extraordinary sights here are the lying Buddha statue which is about 46m long and barely fits on a single picture 
        aswell as the sheer amount of towers on the Temple grounds and, that it´s one of the only 5 places in Thailand which are part of the UNESCO "Memory of the World" register.

    </li>
  <li><a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="dropdownMenuLink1" data-toggle="dropdown">Phra Borom Maha Ratcha Wang / The Grand Palace</a>
      <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuLink1">
      <a class="dropdown-item" href="#"></a> Construction started in 1782 and it´s still in use to this day. The entrance fee is relatively high compared to usual amounts (500baht) for tourists, however it includes 
      not only the huge palace but also entrance to the Queen Sirikit Museum of Textiles, the Arts of the Kingdom Museum, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha aswell as a theatre performance in the Salachalermkrung Royal Theatre.

  <li> The Dome</li>
    <ul> The probably most known skyscraper rooftop. Imagine standing on the roof of a 64 level building and looking down at the lights. The movie "Hangover 2"
        had scenes filmed on here.
    </ul>

  <li> Wat Arun</li>
    <ul> A huge pyramid like building, except there´s ornaments all over it. seeing it up close is very impressive however, I prefered it from a distance at night. There is essentially a light show permanently </ul>
      <img src="Pictures/Pictures Bangkok/Wat Arun1.JPG" style="margin: 2%; max-width: 40%; height:20%">
      <img src="Pictures/Pictures Bangkok/Wat Arun2.JPG" style="margin: 2%; max-width: 40%; height:20%">

  <li> Icon Siam </li>
    <ul> A very large shopping mall nothing like what you can find in germany. Here are not only dozens and dozens of shops including luxury brands, car shops, a movie theatre, an art gallery and several balconies, but also a market like any 
      other street market.....except it´s indoors. It´s so large we literally got lost several times. Oh, and while I´m at it: there´s also a waterfall indoors.</ul>
