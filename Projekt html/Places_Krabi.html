        <ol style="margin-top: 20px;"> You often won´t really be able to tell islands apart from one another. I went to around 7 and can only distinguish between 3. </ol>

    <h4 id="Railay Beach"> Railay Beach</h4>
      <ol> <ul> Known for not exactly being an Island. To be exact it´s on a half island cut off by mountains so you can only really reach it by boat</ul></ol>

    <h4 id="Ko Phi Phi"> Ko Phi Phi Island </h4>
     <ol> <ul> Famous for a movie with Leonardo Di Caprio Ko Phi Phi´s "Maya Bay" might be the most known out of all of them. I´m not overexaggerating when I say the sand is so fine it´d pass through any sieve. The lagoon has sheer crystal clear water and offers a great view on the Mountains and the water. </ul></ol>

    <h4> Chicken Island </h4>
      <ol> <ul> I don´t particularly find it very impressive. It got the name from a rock that´s somewhat shaped like a chicken head but it´s so nondescript that I only heard about it after the boat already passed it. </ul></ol>

    <h4 id="Monkey Beach"> Monkey Beach </h4>
    <ol> <ul> It´s another not must have. It´s part of a lot of tours and yes there were some monkeys. However, a tourist on another tour decided to (and yes it seems very weird) bring a Banana to the island and fight a monkey over it.
    He had to be brought to a hospital so we weren´t even allowed to enter the island and considering that there were other tourists swarming the monkeys seeing anything was impossible.    </ul></ol>
   
    <h4 id="Nopparat Thara Beach"> Nopparat Thara Beach</h4>
      <ol> <ul> The probably most known beach in Krabi. It´s a beach on the mainland that is right next to the local night market and city shops. The beach in itself isn´t particularly special aside from it´s perfect location and the fact, that you can see hundreds of tiny crabs.
        I absolutely loved the Sunset here or watching one of the fire shows on the market or the japanese restaurant "Reeve"</ul></ol>
