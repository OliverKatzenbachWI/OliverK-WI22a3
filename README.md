Project Software Engineering dhbw

The webside consists of 9 viewable html sides aswell as 2 css and 2 js files. 2 each because i had to run a lot of tests and wanted everything related to the currency converter seperated (test2.html ; script.js ; style.css).
Other than that the filesystem is quite clearly labeled with Checklist_*.html , Places_*.html and time_*.html being the other 8 viewable parts in addition to Project.html as the Homepage. Project.js and Project.css are related to those 9.
The currency converter I based a lot on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/currency-converter-in-javascript/ .


The project is not to be distributed further as-is, considering you can recognize people on some of the images.
